                    fighting what comes naturally. Before
                    we might have thought, ‘We need to

                <h3>Xavier de Rosnay & Gaspard Augé</h3>
                <p>Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few
                    mutual friends, who happened to run a record label,
                    seeking tracks for a compilation. With an immediate
                    connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
                    making a song. That’s when they created their
                    breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good,
                    funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
                    contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
                    director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records,
                    who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
                    later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.
